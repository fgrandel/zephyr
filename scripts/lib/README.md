This folder contains shared python packages that may be used across Zephyr
python scripts.

We may publishing these packages to PyPi now and then for access from external
tools on an as-needed basis but for the moment being we won't maintain any
specific release or milestone plan.

# python-devicetree

We used to maintain the devicetree package in its own repository. But this
effort has been given up.

The only code being maintained, contributed to and continuously documented is
the one in this repository and folder, other sources are obsolete and must no
longer be used or referenced.
