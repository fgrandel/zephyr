    SNTP server configuration.

    SNTP server configuration nodes SHALL be given unique names ("labels") along
    the pattern "sntp-[a-z0-9-]+" that can be referenced by interface
    configurations "by label". The address part of the node is used to identify
    the SNTP server instance and does not have other meaning.
