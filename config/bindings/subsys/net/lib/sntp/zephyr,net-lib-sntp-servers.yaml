  The SNTP library is part of the network subsystem. SNTP servers can be
  configured and shared across interfaces using this binding. To use an SNTP
  server in your network configuration, refer to it with a pointer, see
  `zephyr/config/bindings/subsys/net/zephyr,net.yaml`.

  While in principle SNTP server configuration can be placed everywhere in the
  configuration, it is recommended to use the canonical location
  /subsys/net/lib/sntp-servers.

    SNTP server configuration.

    SNTP server configuration nodes SHOULD be given unique node names so that
    interface configurations can refer to them "by label" rather than "by path".
