/**
 * @brief Any occurrence of net_time_t specifies a concept of nanosecond
 * resolution scalar time span, future (positive) or past (negative) relative
 * time or absolute timestamp referred to some local network uptime reference
 * clock that does not wrap during uptime and is - in a certain, well-defined
 * sense - common to all local network interfaces, sometimes even to remote
 * interfaces on the same network.
 *
 * This type is EXPERIMENTAL. Usage is currently restricted to representation of
 * time within the network subsystem.
 *
 * @details Timed network protocols (PTP, TDMA, ...) usually require several
 * local or remote interfaces to share a common notion of elapsed time within
 * well-defined tolerances. Network uptime therefore differs from time
 * represented by a single hardware counter peripheral in that it will need to
 * be represented in several distinct hardware peripherals with different
 * frequencies, accuracy and precision. To co-operate, these hardware counters
 * will have to be "syntonized" or "disciplined" (i.e. frequency and phase
 * locked) with respect to a common local or remote network reference time
 * signal. Be aware that while syntonized clocks share the same frequency and
 * phase, they do not usually share the same epoch (zero-point).
 *
 * This also explains why network time, if represented as a cycle value of some
 * specific hardware counter, will never be "precise" but only can be "good
 * enough" with respect to the tolerances (resolution, drift, jitter) required
 * by a given network protocol. All counter peripherals involved in a timed
 * network protocol must comply with these tolerances.
 *
 * Please use specific @ref k_timepoint_t counter values rather than net_time_t
 * whenever possible especially when referring to the kernel system clock or
 * values of any single counter peripheral.
 *
 * net_time_t cannot represent general clocks referred to an arbitrary epoch as
 * it only covers roughly +/- ~290 years. It also cannot be used to represent
 * time according to a more complex timescale (e.g. including leap seconds, time
 * adjustments, complex calendars or time zones). In these cases you may use
 * @ref timespec (C11, POSIX.1-2001), @ref timeval (POSIX.1-2001) or broken down
 * time as in @ref tm (C90). The advantage of net_time_t over these structured
 * time representations is lower memory footprint, faster and simpler scalar
 * arithmetics and easier conversion from/to low-level hardware counter values.
 * Also net_time_t can be used in the network stack as well as in applications
 * while POSIX concepts cannot. Converting net_time_t from/to structured time
 * representations is possible in a limited way but - except for @ref timespec -
 * requires concepts that must be implemented by higher-level APIs. Utility
 * functions converting from/to @ref timespec will be provided as part of the
 * net_time_t API as and when needed.
 *
 * If you want to represent more coarse grained scalar time in network
 * applications, use @ref time_t (C99, POSIX.1-2001) which is specified to
 * represent seconds or @ref suseconds_t (POSIX.1-2001) for microsecond
 * resolution. Kernel @ref k_ticks_t and cycles (both specific to Zephyr) have
 * an unspecified resolution but are useful to represent the kernel's notion of
 * time and implement high resolution spinning.
 *
 * If you need even finer grained time resolution, you may want to look at
 * (g)PTP concepts, see @ref net_ptp_extended_time.
 *
 * The reason why we don't use int64_t directly to represent scalar nanosecond
 * resolution times in the network stack is that it has been shown in the past
 * that fields using generic type will often not be used correctly (e.g. with
 * the wrong resolution or to represent underspecified concepts of time with
 * unclear syntonization semantics).
 *
 * Any API that exposes or consumes net_time_t values SHALL ensure that it
 * maintains the specified contract including all protocol specific tolerances
 * and therefore clients can rely on common semantics of this type. This makes
 * times coming from different hardware peripherals and even from different
 * network nodes comparable within well-defined limits and therefore net_time_t
 * is the ideal intermediate building block for timed network protocols.

 * @brief Monotonic network uptime counter of a given interface.
 *
 * Network uptime counter implementations SHOULD wrap two distinct hardware
 * counter peripherals. One high-resolution counter that provides best accuracy
 * of timeouts, hardware-supported scheduling and timestamping of TX and RX. And
 * one always-on, low-power, low-resolution sleep counter that will bridge long
 * waiting times.
 *
 * The timer is considered to be "suspended" when its high-resolution counter is
 * not powered. It is "active" when its high-resolution mode counter is
 * operational. The sleep counter MAY remain operational in "active" mode. The
 * timer SHALL be "suspended" initially.
 *
 * If "suspended", the counter SHALL switch to "active" mode early enough before
 * a scheduled timer fires so that the timer does not oversleep. The counter
 * SHALL NOT be suspended unless its may_sleep() function has been called. The
 * counter SHALL be suspended as quickly as possible when its may_sleep()
 * function has been called. If sleep mode is not supported, calls to
 * may_sleep() are no-ops.
 *
 * TODO: Use runtime driver power management API instead.
 *
 * Synchronization between the sleep counter and the high-resolution counter
 * SHOULD be done in hardware for lowest synchronization jitter and latency.
 *
 * Switching between the sleep counter and the high-resolution counter MUST not
 * violate the requirement of monotonic uptime, i.e. the value returned by
 * get_current_timepoint() SHALL never jump backwards. In suspended mode the
 * counter MAY jump forwards i.e. certain timepoints MAY be left out. This
 * SHALL, however, NOT lead to timeouts being lost.
 *
 * Uptime counters MAY be implemented internally building upon hardware
 * peripherals directly, existing drivers such as counter.h, system_timer.h or
 * rtc.h drivers. Typical sleep counters would be rtc.h or system_timer.h
 * drivers or counter.h drivers wrapping a low-power, always-on counter
 * peripheral. Typical high-resolution counters would be based on counter.h or
 * system_timer.h.
 *
 * As hardware synchronization of sleep and high-resolution counters requires
 * knowledge of both peripherals at hardware level, these drivers need to be
 * amended by low-level synchronization code in the network uptime counter
 * implementation. Switching between suspended and active mode will also require
 * additional code that is specific to each network uptime counter
 * implementation. This is the reason why network uptime counters require their
 * own API above existing counter APIs.
