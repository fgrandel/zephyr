  Network interface configuration.

  All nodes using this binding SHOULD be called "iface" or "iface@<u32>". At
  build time, devicetree nodes representing a network device MAY have exactly as
  many "iface[@<u32>]" child nodes with "status = 'okay'" as the corresponding
  device node instantiates network interfaces. In most cases this will be a
  single network interface per device node in which case the address part of the
  "iface" node is optional.

  If a single devicetree node instantiates more than one network interface, then
  the "iface" nodes SHOULD be named "iface@0", "iface@1", etc.

  Note: The interface node's address part has no semantic meaning other than
  uniquely identifying instances of interface nodes. Notably the address part
  does not correspond to the interface index.

    description: Sets a non-default interface name. If not set, the interface
      name will be the interface's device name.

  set-flags:
    type: int

      A bitmask of network interface flags that shall be added to this
      interface. See the ``net_if_flag`` documentation for details of the flags.

      The following flags can be set or cleared:
      ``NET_IF_POINTOPOINT``, ``NET_IF_PROMISC``, ``NET_IF_NO_AUTO_START``,
      ``NET_IF_FORWARD_MULTICASTS``, ``NET_IF_IPV6_NO_ND``,
      ``NET_IF_IPV6_NO_MLD``

      Your configuration needs to include
      <zephyr/dt-bindings/subsys/net/if_flags.h> if you use this property.

      A bitmask of network interface flags that shall be removed from this
