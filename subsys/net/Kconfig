	help
	  Interval in seconds of Network buffer allocation warnings which are
	  generated when a buffer cannot immediately be allocated with K_FOREVER
	  which may lead to deadlocks. Setting it to 0 makes warnings to be
	  printed only once per allocation.

	help
	  Enable extra debug logs and checks for the generic network buffers.

config NET_BUF_POOL_USAGE
	bool "Network buffer pool usage tracking"
	help
	  Enable network buffer pool tracking. This means that:
	  * amount of free buffers in the pool is remembered
	  * total size of the pool is calculated
	  * pool name is stored and can be shown in debugging prints

	  May be selected by time sensitive protocols (e.g. PTP, TSCH, TSN,
	  etc.) that require a precision local network reference clock
	  syntonized (i.e. frequency and phase locked) across local network
	  interfaces and/or network nodes. The network time reference does not
	  guarantee a common timescale (epoch, leap seconds, etc.). Support for
	  system-wide timescales requires higher level clock APIs. Time
	  syntonization requires dedicated hardware and driver support by
	  participating network interface drivers.
